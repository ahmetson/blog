                <p>Turkmen are primarily descendants of Iranian nomads who lived between the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>When you are learning the history of a nation, you do a comprehensive analysis of the country from all aspects: tradition, language, and anthropology. Most people who talk about Turkmen as people who came from Altai do not know who the Turkmen are or their traditions.</p>
<p>Without knowing the history, you might get the generalized view that ancient Turkmen were nomadic warriors who drank horse milk and ate horse meat. They were a people with slanted eyes and built Kurgans for their ancestors.</p>
<p>But Turkmens didn't have slanted eyes, except for the minority. They never farmed horses for meat or milk. And they never built Kurgans for the ancestors.</p>
<hr>
<p>Regarding horse tradition, Turkmenians raised horses for races and battles only. These breeds, in medieval times, were known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkoman_horse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turkoman Horses</a>. These horses are the ancestors of all racing horses in the world. The German Trakehner breed's ancestor: "Turkmen Atti"</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artnet.com/artists/johann-meno-haas/turcmainatti-SgqtHdf3XfLTfFtUN_nTgA2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turcmanatti by Johan Meno Haas in the 1790s.</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The English Throughbroud's ancestor: Byerly Turk:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Byerly_Turk.jpg" alt="Byerly Turk by John Wootton" width="500" height="400" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>You do a DNA analysis, and the closest to all horses are not Arabian, but Akhal Teke (one of the lineage of Turkmen horses named after the Teke tribe).</p>
<p>The Turkmen horses are indigenous to Central Asia and have been famous since the Antique period. The Chinese conquered modern Xinjiang, part of Central Asia, to acquire these horses as they were well-known there as Heavenly horses.</p>
<p>Ancient Greek and Roman historians described them as the best in the world. This breed has thousands of years of history. And while the breed's name has changed, it's still part of Antique Central Asian history.</p>
<p>But here is the thing: Neither Central Asian sedentary Iranians nor Nomadic Turk-Mongolian people except Turkmens were breeding them. From the ancient nomads, this tradition is carried out by Turkmens. And not by one tribe in the region to say it's the influence, but by all tribes, so it's part of national culture.</p>
<p>A depiction of <a href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Turkoman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turkmen horse in the Read Dead Redemption 2</a> (click to see on Wiki Fandom): </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/reddeadredemption/images/0/0b/Black_Turkoman.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20221216080258" alt="" width="350" height="272" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p> The same goes for all other aspects of Turkmen culture. Turkmen have a heavy influence from other people around them and, to a lesser degree, by people along the "Silk Road". But it's a cultural exchange that went bidirectional. As much as Turkmens have it, they also influenced other people.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the problem of Iranians. When they see Iranian influence, they brag about Greater Iran. Still, when influenced, they want to dismiss the national terminology, discussing regional and Islamic shared culture. To make it fair, either ignore "Iranian" influence by removing national appearance. Or accept that you have Arabic and Turkic influence, too.</p>
<p>This is especially seen on Wikipedia, where Nowruz is an Iranian national holiday and Iranian influence. Just like anything that interacted with them. But Turkmen carpets are Iranian because they're part of their day-to-day culture, and they should not be connected with Turkmen only.</p>

                <h2>Chapter 2: Production</h2>
<p>Start with the objective when designing your model.</p>
<p>For example, Google started with the objective: "<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the user's main objective in typing in a search query?</span></em>" This led to the aim to "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>show the most relevant search result.</em></span>"</p>
<p>The next step is to determine what actions you can take to achieve the objective. In Google's case, it was ranking search results.</p>
<p>The third step is determining what new data you need for the actions. In Google's case, what new data would they need to produce such a ranking?</p>
<p>They realized that the implicit information regarding which pages linked to which other page could be useful for this purpose.</p>
<p>We begin thinking about building a predictive model after these three steps. The objective, levers, the data we have, and the data we need determine the model we make. The models will take the levers and uncontrollable variables as their inputs; the output can be combined to predict the final state of the objective.</p>
<h3>Recap by answering the questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>If the images for the bear classifier are from the game, then the app won't work because it was trained with the photo of the real bears.</li>
<li>The text models cannot understand the semantics. This could lead to incorrect predictions.</li>
<li>Text models could be used to troll the internet to spread disinformation.</li>
<li>Usage of AI doesn't guarantee 100% results. It's especially critical with the medical reports. One solution is to work en-par with the people. The highly predictive outputs could be automated. For less predicted outcomes, we can do a manual check.</li>
<li>The AI is good at high cardinality tabular data. The high cardinality means it's something that contains ample discrete choices.</li>
<li>The recommendation systems work with user-generated behaviors. It recommends similar products from other sales. But it doesn't mean users didn't see them or may want something others didn't pick yet.</li>
<li>Drivetrain approach: a) define an objective. b) define actions to reach the objective. c) define the data you need for the actions.</li>
<li>Drivetrain approach for the video recommendation system: a) keep users in the platform. b) find liked videos like this from people of similar taste. c) create a data of liked data.</li>
<li>The DataLoader class prepares data for training from unprepared data.</li>
<li>To create a DataLoader, we need four things: a) What kind of data are we working with: images and text? b) How do you get those data: from files, CSV, or SQL? c) How do you label the items by filename? d) How to create a validation set: split items randomly by a seed.</li>
<li>The splitter parameter of DataLoader describes how to get the validation set from the items list.</li>
<li>The splitter takes two arguments: the percentage of items in the validation set and a seed to generate a random list.</li>
<li>To determine independent variables, we use X. To represent dependent variables, we use Y.</li>
<li>When images have different sizes, we need to normalize them—crop, pad, or squish.</li>
<li>Data augmentation creates variants of the item by applying transforming functions. It helps to increase the amount of training set.</li>
<li>Item transformers apply a function to each data. Batch transformers use the function of a whole batch.</li>
<li>The confusion matrix shows a table of the training results. It helps to debug the data we used for training.</li>
<li>The export function saves the architecture and model parameters together.</li>
<li>To use a prediction model instead for training is called inference.</li>
<li>IPython widgets are GUI components combining JavaScript and Python codes.</li>
<li>we may use CPU in production since we work with one item at a time. In training, we may use GPU to accelerate the process.</li>
<li>If a model is on a server, then there is a risk of working with confidential user data. Or network latency may slow down the prediction.</li>
<li>the camera might capture the bears from different angles for a bear classifier, but it didn't work with the night vision. The camera may have low resolution.</li>
<li>Out of domain is when an image for inference is not in a category of images we used for training.</li>
<li>The domain shift is when the type of data changes over time.</li>
<li>Three deployment process steps: a) export model for inference. b) create a UI. c) host the model.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Objective: Understand the text in depth. Users should not be distracted.</p>
<p>Action: Track all words users encounter.</p>
<p>Then, get the description and insert it into the context. If it's a link, get a summary and add it. </p>
<p>Data: track all words the user knows. Track how often he read and keep the terminology until it won't increase in appearance.</p>
<p>What should happen if it went out? Everyone on the internet uses it.</p>

                <p>The 7th October 2023 event is a terrific event that occurred in Israel.</p>
<p>What I want is for Israelis to show mercy for this. Because the politics that Hamas is playing versus what Israel is playing are on the different level.</p>
<p>Israel is more powerful than the established, prosperous nuclear power supported by the collective West, especially by the USA.</p>
<p>To have a piece, we should have mercy. What I despise is that Israel is pretending to be merciful because mercy is not a punishment but forgiveness. Where is the mercy in the warnings when they want to punish Palestinians anyway?</p>
<p>Another thing I despise in the politics of Israel is playing the victim when they are the aggressor against Palestinians.</p>
<p>What is the real mercy is when in Africa, white people were ruling over the black people, some black people uprised against them. They used all methods to be heard—mainly bombing near the schools.</p>
<p>Eventually, they took the victory and brought justice to the black people by giving them the same rights as white people. Nelson Mandela, the leader of this uprising, was named Person of the Year. He is respected by the West, which didn't focus too much on his bombings.</p>
<p>What is the solution for Israel giving up half of the land to the Palestinians? To avoid revenge and hatred from their side, Israel, as the wealthiest country, could compensate with money by helping to build Palestine by modernizing it.</p>
<p>Rather than spending much on the military budget, they could pay more on building Palestine. Jews would not be richer and have a comfortable life as today, but in return, they would get peace, and they wouldn't have to fear danger behind the border.</p>
<hr>
<p>When a girl X breaks up with a boyfriend and feels a massive hatred in her heart, she casts on porn or goes to a club to have nights with dozens of people. You can't have mercy on such kind of people too much.</p>
<p>When girl Y is sent to trade her body at age 15 by her alcoholic parents, the girl is doing the same bad, unjustified things as girl X. But you should have mercy on girl Y because of the conditions that created it.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Deep Learning is a computer technique to extract and transform data using multiple neural network layers.</p>
<p>Top used use cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>NLP: answer questions; speech recognition; summarize; classify; find; search</li>
<li>Computer Vision: satellite image interpretation, face recognition, caption</li>
<li>Medicine: finding anomalies; counting features in slides; measuring; diagnosing</li>
<li>Biology: classifying genomic tasks; analyzing cell interactions</li>
<li>Image Generation</li>
<li>Recommend Systems: search engines, home page layout, product recommendation</li>
<li>Playing Games</li>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>Financial, Logistics, etc...</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts developed a mathematical model of artificial neurons. It's declared in "<em>A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in Neurous Activity</em>."</p>
<p>The neuron could be represented as addition and thresholding.</p>

<p>Frank Rosenblatt gave artificial neurons the ability to learn. He even created the first device on this principle: <strong>Mark I Perceptron</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are now about to witness the birth of such a machine - capable of perceiving, recognizing, and identifying the surroundings without any human training or context.</p>
<p class="align-right">"The Design of an Intelligent Automata"</p>
<p class="align-right">Frank Rosenblatt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert wrote a book called "<em>Perceptrons</em>." They showed that the device needs multiple layers to learn simple mathematical functions.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most pivotal work in neural networks was the "<em>Parallel Distributed Processes</em>" by David Rumelhart, James McCallen, and the PDP Research Group, released in 1986.</p>
<p>PDP approach for the programming framework defined requires:</p>
<ol>
<li>process unit sets</li>
<li>state of activation</li>
<li>output function for each unit</li>
<li>connectivity pattern among units</li>
<li>propagation rule for propagating through the network of connectivities</li>
<li>activation rule for combining inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce output for the unit</li>
<li>learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience</li>
<li>an environment where PDP must operate</li>
</ol>
<p>Modern Neural Networks use an approach similar to PDP. </p>
<p class="msg msg--info msg--highlight  ">The book says that the theoretical knowledge was misunderstood, and the issues held back the development until 2010. But also says that despite having two layers, it was too big and too slow to be helpful. Recent advancements in the hardware allowed training neural networks with more layers.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">For learning, it is best to use Jupyter Notebooks. The Jupyter Notebooks are software that allows you to include assets and code together.</p>
<p>The deep learning uses the neural networks. It's part of machine learning. The deep learning model process and its training apply to the general concepts of machine learning.</p>
<p>Machine learning is another form of programming where instead of the algorithm, you write the desired output, and the software finds the path.</p>
<p>The term "machine learning" was coined by Arthur Samuel from IBM in 1949. In his 1962 classic essay "<em>Artificial Intelligence: A Frontier of Automation,</em>" he wrote machine technique.</p>
<p>Rather than describing each step to solve the task, show an example of the problem to solve. Then, let the program figure out the algorithm.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is an actual performance of weight assignment. Then, there is an automatic means of testing performance—a mechanism for improving performance by changing weight assignments.</p>
<p>The weights are variables. The weight assignments are a choice of those variables. The program inputs are variables. </p>
<p>In modern terminology, machine learning programs are called models.</p>
<p>The weight assignment is the second input describing the actual input. In modern terminology, weight assignments are called model parameters.</p>
<p>Automatic testing means you let two models work against each other. Actual performance is the desired result. After each iteration, you adjust the model to test the outcome.</p>
<p>If you automate the iteration to adjust the model parameters, the program could learn from experience.</p>
<p>This automatic iteration is called model training.</p>
<p>Once the weights were adjusted, they became part of the model. </p>
<p>The neural networks are mathematical functions. The mathematical proof called the Universal Approximation Theorem shows this function can solve any problem in theory.</p>
<p>The general approach to adjusting weights is made via Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a mathematical method.</p>
<p>The model includes weight, a function producing results, and performance updating weights. The functional part is called architecture.</p>
<p>Prediction is the result. The loss is the measurement of the performance. It's measured against the labels.</p>
<p>Transformers are code that is applied during the training. There are item and batch transformers. The inputs are not used to train. Some part of the set is kept separated to test that training.</p>
<p>The training input is called a training set, while testing data is used as a validation set. Over time, as the validation set is set, the model starts memorizing the labels. Thus, it doesn't find the generalizing patterns. This is called overfitting.</p>
<p>Overfitting is the single, most important issue in the model training.</p>
<p>Resnet is one of the architectures. It could have 18, 34, 50, 101 and 150 layers. The more layers mean training and with less data will be prone to overfitting.</p>
<p>The model that has trained weights is called pre-trained model. It's better to build on the pre-trained models by changing some layers with yours. Using pre-trained model for a task different than what it was originally trained is called transfer learning.</p>
<p>Fine tuning is a transfer learning technique where parameters of pretrained models update by additional epoch. Epoch is how many times the model looks at the data.</p>
<p>Machine learning has some limitations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>A model can not be created without data</li>
<li>It can learn the patterns from input data</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Deep Learning Vocabulary</h2>
<p>Label - a data we are trying to predict</p>
<p>Architecture - a template of a model we are tring to fit a model; an actual function</p>
<p>Parameters - values in model that change what task it can do and updates throughout the training process.</p>
<p>Fit - update the parameters such that predictions of model using input to match output labels. Also called Train.</p>
<p>Fine Tune - special technique in transfer learning to update pre-trained model.</p>
<p>Epoch - one complete task to pass through input data</p>
<p>Loss - a measure how good model is using validation set</p>
<p>Training set - data for training</p>
<p>Validation set - data for measuring loss</p>
<p>Overfitting - training remembers specific features of input than generalizing pattern.</p>
<p>CNN - neural network for computer vision</p>
