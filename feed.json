            "content_html": "<p>2 August 2021</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being myself in the crypto industry and as a developer, I never thought I would be scammed. But that happened. And it happened quickly.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was using </span><a href=\"https://farmfol.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://farmfol.io/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to track my wallet balance. And saw that it has 100K USD. I thought that someone deposited his tokens to me accidentally. So, I researched the token. The token is called Vera. And it’s domain name is </span><a href=\"http://thevera.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http://thevera.io/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The website had a “claim” button. I clicked on it to approve my wallet. Then, I suddenly realized that they might withdraw my crypto wallet. It was on Binance bright chain, where transaction confirmation speed is 3-4 seconds. I was a few seconds late before the transaction was confirmed. As a result, I was screwed for 2BNB (~600$).</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I tried to remove the token from my wallet but without luck. Then I tried to transfer tokens to an empty address, but that didn’t work either.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokens are smart contracts where the token developer programs every token function. The developer of the Vera token puts a high fee on any transaction or completely rejects any method call.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This case also proved my Blockchain idea that makes users own their wallets and accounts. What is the point of having a private key when the tokens in my balance are without my acknowledgment? Or when I can’t do anything with them because the developers decided like this.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: The Seascape blockchain will have one token with unlimited minting. When users create a new token, they allocate the part of the native token and add an alias name. Since the core part of the token is a native token, the transferring and burning of the token will be available for any user.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides that, since all tokens are backed by the native token, through the native token, users will be able to exchange tokens with each other without any dex.</span></p>",

By fast numbers, I mean that a) predicting what the next number is impossible, and b)  It generates numbers without putting them in favor of one of the stakeholders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The nature of public blockchain, with its decentralized p2p architecture, is ideal for producing secure numbers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This whitepaper discusses the implementation of secure random numbers using blockchain. </span></p>\n<h1><strong>GOALS OF THE PROJECT</strong></h1>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free public random number generator</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secure, where numbers are not predictable.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generated numbers are stored in the database permanently for checking in the future</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generated numbers are not programmed to drop specific numbers with high probability.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h1><strong>RNG V 0.0 User-generated numbers</strong></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the creation of the blockchain takes some time, we decided to make a quick version of the RNG. This short version of the RNG blockchain is versioned as 0.0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this version, the nodes accessing the RNG send a random number in their transactions. The sum of all random numbers divided by all senders within the block is defined as a new Random number for the block.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RNG V 0.0 will have the following transitions:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Request a new Random number   (DONE)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- accepts (one random number) in byte32 format. This number is used to generate a random number. To get a random number, the caller should stake some tokens.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- returns another random number in byte32 format. It requires 0.01 RNG tokens to be cut from the staked RNG tokens.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Send a random number</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- accepts (one random number) in byte32 format.

The sum of all unique wallet addresses divided by the number of voters is the Generated Random number of that block. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We came up with three solutions to prove that the signature is nondeterministic.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any node that participates in the generation of random numbers also has a representative signature. This signature stakes 100 RNG tokens, which allows this node to participate in number generation. Any unique signature used once can be used to withdraw 50% of the staked RNG tokens per user from the blockchain within the next 30 days after usage of the signature. Suppose the unique signature is used for withdrawing a token. In that case, the representative node is kicked out from the participation of random number generation, while the rest of 50% of staked RNG tokens are redistributed among other stakeholders. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it is in the interest of all stakeholders to try to find the signature or guess it for the other stakeholders to prevent them from cheating.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The node client should always be public, meaning everyone could join the blockchain for random number generation without anyone’s permission. Since the sum of the hash of all wallets is changing dramatically even after the addition of one more signature, it will allow the blockchain to be unpredictable if many nodes connect to the blockchain from around the world.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is the option where anyone, whether a unique signature or representative signature or not related to the RNG signature, can put 1 RNG token, the future block number, and the possible value. If the value generated in the future in the block number is correct, the wallet address could take 50% of all stake RNGs in the blockchain. This will keep all stakes trying to put unpredictable signatures, while those who want to earn money will always try to check the blockchain for prediction. This will ensure that generated random numbers are safe.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>RNG Blockchain Technical Requirements</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a blockchain in Cosmos Network created with Cosmos SDK on the tendermint core.
