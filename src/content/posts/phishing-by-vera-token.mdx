<p>2 August 2021</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being myself in the crypto industry and as a developer, I never thought I would be scammed. But that happened. And it happened quickly.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was using </span><a href="https://farmfol.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://farmfol.io/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to track my wallet balance. And saw that it has 100K USD. I thought that someone deposited his tokens to me accidentally. So, I researched the token. The token is called Vera. And it’s domain name is </span><a href="http://thevera.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://thevera.io/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website had a “claim” button. I clicked on it to approve my wallet. Then, I suddenly realized that they might withdraw my crypto wallet. It was on Binance bright chain, where transaction confirmation speed is 3-4 seconds. I was a few seconds late before the transaction was confirmed. As a result, I was screwed for 2BNB (~600$).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to remove the token from my wallet but without luck. Then I tried to transfer tokens to an empty address, but that didn’t work either.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokens are smart contracts where the token developer programs every token function. The developer of the Vera token puts a high fee on any transaction or completely rejects any method call.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This case also proved my Blockchain idea that makes users own their wallets and accounts. What is the point of having a private key when the tokens in my balance are without my acknowledgment? Or when I can’t do anything with them because the developers decided like this.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solution: The Seascape blockchain will have one token with unlimited minting. When users create a new token, they allocate the part of the native token and add an alias name. Since the core part of the token is a native token, the transferring and burning of the token will be available for any user.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides that, since all tokens are backed by the native token, through the native token, users will be able to exchange tokens with each other without any dex.</span></p>
