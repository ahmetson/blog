<p>I use Steve Jobs' own words: "Innovations lead to the innovations".</p>
<p>His own company, his own products don't lead to the technical innovations.</p>
<p>When you read the history, when there are no new ideas, but a sophistication of what was built, this indicates a decline of the culture. A slow stagnation.</p>
<p>If we value products like iPhone, MacBook for it's candy-crash like UI as the greatest thing in the technology, then it's clearly marks the stagnation of the culture.</p>
<p>I use iPhone (my family bought me as a gift), it never lead me to build something with it. So for me neither Apple, neither Steve Jobs are respected nor role model.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think they have important in the popularization of the technology. Apple is like Chinese internet, it takes the app and packs it in a nice user interface.</p>
<p>These kind of products should be respected by UX designers, not by technology companies. They should take Apple as a role model when it comes to the intuitive user experience when using the technology.</p>
<p>To give you analogy, you can't say google is the better than Yahoo in terms of technology because Google has a minimalistic main page. But that is going on with the Apple.</p>
