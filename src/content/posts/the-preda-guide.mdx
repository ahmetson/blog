<p>Preda is a programming language to write distributed intelligent contracts that can execute transactions in parallel. If you are unfamiliar with the smart contract or want to see what Preda is, look at <a href="https://turkmenson.com/programming-language-preda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Language: Preda</a>, where I wrote some notes about it.</p>
<p>This page describes the projects I wrote in the Preda programming language: "<a href="https://lu.ma/co44nv4x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preda Scale-out Smart Contracts Hackathon</a>".</p>
<p>The best way to learn a technology is by creating something. I will also provide general lessons and valuable resources that helped me write something on Preda.</p>
<h1>Brainstorming</h1>
<p>For the hackathon, we need some ideas to work on. The project will benefit from the parallel execution.</p>
<h2>Invalid directions</h2>
<h3>Top Smartcontracts</h3>
<p>As Preda was targeting top smartcontracts, let's take inspiration from them. However, complete intelligent contracts are all for DeFi. DeFi doesn't solve real-world problems, so let's skip it. </p>
<h3>Top Transactions</h3>
<p>The Bridges and Exchanges load the highest traffic on Ethereum. These smartcontracts are easy to implement, so let's skip it.</p>
<h2>Right direction</h2>
<p>The best way is to implement something impossible with the current smartcontracts and only available with the Preda's parallel execution.</p>
<p>But before working on it, let's create small intelligent contracts to have an understanding of the program in Preda.</p>
<p>And lastly, we are always relying on the libraries with the best practices that save us a lot of headaches.</p>
<p>So, here is the list of the projects that I will be working on:</p>
<ol>
<li>(Library 1) The OpenZeppelin library is a state-of-the-art library for Ethereum. Let's convert it to Preda to bootstrap the creation of smart contracts.<br /><br /></li>
<li>(Library 2) OpenZeppelin Upgradables: This is an interesting part of creating an upgradable contract. Maybe upgrade a certain state, rather than all smartcontract?</li>
<li>(Small project 1) Mistransfer: a project that recovers tokens sent to a wrong smart contract. I wrote it for a Chainlink hackathon. And I believe it should be everywhere. So, let's implement it.</li>
<li>(Small project 2) Malpie: a loyalty program for apps where users provide their data in exchange for a product discount.</li>
<li>(Project)Where does Preda outshine? What kind of app is it possible to make on the blockchain? More in the next section.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Real-time app</h3>
<p>Parallel execution enables real-time applications that were not possible on the blockchain before. What kind of real-time app? Do you know the original motivation behind the creation of the Ethereum?</p>
<p>According to the legends, Vitalik was playing World of Warcraft, and one day, Blizzard Studio decided to remove one of his favorite game items. Outraged, he created a distributed platform where "Code is a law." It's a beautiful legend, so let it be.</p>
<p>However, Ethereum doesn't allow the creation of a game such as World of Warcraft. But with Preda, we can create it. Each popular multiplayer, real-time game is a session. With Preda, we can make each session a scope with access from the users in that session. This allows, for example, to create a Layer 2 on Ethereum with the PREDA model. Fine-tuned, it could keep thousands of users online with less technical cost than without Preda.</p>

<h1>Preda tricks</h1>
<p>return type is inserted in the beginning after the "function" keyword.</p>
<p>to make the contract read-only, replace "view" with "const."</p>
