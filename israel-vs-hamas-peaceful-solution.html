Because the politics that Hamas is playing versus what Israel is playing are on the different level.</p><p>Israel is more powerful than the established, prosperous nuclear power supported by the collective West, especially by the USA.</p><p>To have a piece, we should have mercy. What I despise is that Israel is pretending to be merciful because mercy is not a punishment but forgiveness. Where is the mercy in the warnings when they want to punish Palestinians anyway?</p><p>Another thing I despise in the politics of Israel is playing the victim when they are the aggressor against Palestinians.</p><p>What is the real mercy is when in Africa, white people were ruling over the black people, some black people uprised against them. They used all methods to be heard—mainly bombing near the schools.</p><p>Eventually, they took the victory and brought justice to the black people by giving them the same rights as white people. Nelson Mandela, the leader of this uprising, was named Person of the Year. He is respected by the West, which didn't focus too much on his bombings.</p><p>What is the solution for Israel giving up half of the land to the Palestinians? To avoid revenge and hatred from their side, Israel, as the wealthiest country, could compensate with money by helping to build Palestine by modernizing it.</p><p>Rather than spending much on the military budget, they could pay more on building Palestine. Jews would not be richer and have a comfortable life as today, but in return, they would get peace, and they wouldn't have to fear danger behind the border.</p><hr><p>When a girl X breaks up with a boyfriend and feels a massive hatred in her heart, she casts on porn or goes to a club to have nights with dozens of people. You can't have mercy on such kind of people too much.</p><p>When girl Y is sent to trade her body at age 15 by her alcoholic parents, the girl is doing the same bad, unjustified things as girl X. But you should have mercy on girl Y because of the conditions that created it.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 21 Dec 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://turkmenson.com/tags/israel/">Israel</a></li><li><a href="https://turkmenson.com/tags/palestine/">Palestine</a></li><li><a href="https://turkmenson.com/tags/people/">people</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://turkmenson.com/authors/medet-ahmetson/" rel="author">Medet Ahmetson</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://turkmenson.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://turkmenson.com/notes-on-practical-deep-learning-for-coders.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Notes on &quot;Practical Deep Learning for Coders&quot;</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://turkmenson.com/archived-projects.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Archived projects </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://turkmenson.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>2023 Medet Ahmetson</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://turkmenson.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://turkmenson.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
